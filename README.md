This was my Data Science and Machine Learning course seminar project, which involved 2 parts: scraping the web and then conducting a sentiment analysis on the scraped data. The project was done in Python and the libraries used were Selenium, Pandas, SpaCy, Sklearn, Nltk and more. The project was done in a Jupyter Notebook and the final results were presented in the seminar class. The project was done in the autumn of 2023.
